# hyper-cloj

[Clojure](http://clojure.org) based implementations and
interpretations of the examples in
*[Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020530.do)*.


## Description

[Mike Amundsen](http://amundsen.com/blog), the author of
*[Building Hypermedia APIs](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020530.do)*,
provides helpful direction for programmers seeking to understand and
apply the principles of
[Representational state transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
(REST), and in particular
[HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) *(Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)*.

In his recent book, Amundsen implements his examples principally with
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). This is my attempt to re-implement, or perhaps reinterpret,
those examples in terms of the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) language and popular
web-related libraries from the Clojure community.
